**Hi Guys, my name is Anil Kulkarni, and I am writing this guide as part of my learning process through Golang.**

*It contains actual code examples and lot of explanation either in the comments of the code or readme files in each chapter.*

Most of the writeup is from a new programmers point of new, I hope this would help you in understand Go better and avoid lot of pitfalls which I have encountered while learning Go.

I am trying to update this repo each day with new topics and hope to complete some basic & intermediate Golang till Oct, 2018

Since, I am also learning, any contributions in better code, code samples, documentation would be really appreciated !
